📌 Objective

To analyze the Iris dataset and build a Machine Learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on sepal and petal measurements.

📊 Dataset

150 samples

4 features (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width)

3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔄 Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset

Explored and analyzed data

Visualized features using plots

Preprocessed data and split into train/test sets

Trained models (Logistic Regression, KNN)

Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

✅ Outcome

Model successfully classified flowers with 95–100% accuracy

Petal features gave the best predictions

Gained practical knowledge of ML workflow and Scikit-learn
